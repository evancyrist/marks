John Reed Start, former Chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement has characterized a recent cluster of SEC actions as a “crypto exchange crackdown.” He predicts that exchanges will need to stop doing business in the US (in their current form).

Right out of the gates in 2023, a series of actions have been taken against crypto companies. What follows are some of the most recent ones.

The SEC charged the Beaxy exchange and its executives with failing to register as an exchange, the founder with raising $8M in an unregistered offering, and alleged misappropriation of investor funds for personal use.

The SEC also charged liquidity providers on Beaxy as operating as unregistered dealers. Crypto exchanges can’t work without liquidity, and we may now see some of the larger professional market making firms (US headquartered companies) withdraw from operating on unregulated exchanges. This forces exchanges to come into compliance indirectly.

Bittrex has received a Wells Notice for failing to register as an exchange.

Coinbase has received a Wells Notice for violation of securities laws (staking services, wallet services, and listing certain tokens). Coinbase’s CEO has started that the company is preparing to go to court with the SEC. The SEC’s action may seek injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.
